### Nice to meet ya 👋, I'm Jenn!

😄 Pronouns: she/her

I'm a 3️⃣rd year student 👩🏻‍🏫 at Brown University studying Computer Science 💻 and International and Public Affairs with an interest in tech policy and human-centered computing. My work centers around a passion to mobilize technology for social good, as I seek to connect the fruits of technological development with the socioeconomic concerns that have long plagued public policy.

🔬 Research interests: algorithmic fairness, HCI, AI auditing

⚡ Fun fact: In my free time, I love cafe-hopping ☕️, baking pies 🥧, binging studio ghibli movies 🍿, and playing chess ♟.

📫 How to reach me: You can shoot me an [email](mailto:jennifer_wang@brown.edu) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-wang-b156b81b1/). Don't worry, I don't bite <3
